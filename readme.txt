Currently just a library for parsing table/field definitions pumped out by
OpenEdge's data dictionary. It represents the tables and fields as maps for
fast access/comparison times.

Tools soon to come or in progress (ha ha!):
    - See common field names between two tables (working, but ugly)
    - Search all tables for a field name (IP)
    - Graphical utility for Windows (Not even IP)
